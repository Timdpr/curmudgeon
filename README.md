# curmudgeon

> Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.

A `git clone` — sorry, _git clone_ — based on [@thblt](https://github.com/thblt)'s wonderful [write-yourself-a-git](https://wyag.thb.lt "Seriously, check it out!").

Created with Python 3.7. And git. It's a bit of gitception, except my git is more of a git than git is: it's a curmudgeon.
